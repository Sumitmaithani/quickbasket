[11:20 AM] Customer: The Sleepy Owl Cold Coffee bottle in my order has a cracked cap and it leaked all over the other items in the bag. My paneer packet and bread are soaked in coffee. This is a mess.

[11:22 AM] Agent: Oh no, Tanvi! I'm so sorry about that. That sounds terrible. Let me check your order ORD-889520 right away. Could you share a photo of the damage if possible?

[11:24 AM] Customer: Sent the photo. You can see the coffee pooling at the bottom of the bag. The paneer box is soaked and the bread packet is completely wet.

[11:26 AM] Agent: Thank you for the photo, Tanvi. I can clearly see the damage — the bottle cap is cracked and the leak affected multiple items. Here's what I'm doing: (1) Replacement order for all three damaged items — Sleepy Owl Cold Coffee (₹120), Fresh Paneer 200g (₹80), and Whole Wheat Bread (₹45). That's ₹245 total. The replacement will be delivered in the next available slot, which is today between 2-4 PM.

[11:27 AM] Customer: That works. But the cold coffee bottle shouldn't have been packed in the same bag as perishables. One leaky bottle ruined three items.

[11:29 AM] Agent: You're absolutely right. Beverages and bottles should be packed separately from perishables — that's actually in our packing guidelines. I'm reporting this as a packing error. The replacement order has been created (ORD-889520-R) and you'll receive a notification when it's dispatched. No need to return the damaged items.

[11:30 AM] Customer: Great, thanks Priyanka. Hoping for better packing this time!

[11:30 AM] Agent: I've added a special note to the replacement order for careful packing. Sorry again for the mess, Tanvi. Have a great day!
