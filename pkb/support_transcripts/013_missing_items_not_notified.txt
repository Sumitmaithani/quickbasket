[01:15 PM] Customer: My order just arrived and the broccoli I ordered is missing. I didn't get any notification about it being removed. I found out only after checking the items against my order.

[01:17 PM] Agent: Hi Lakshmi! I'm sorry about the missing broccoli. Let me check order ORD-888742 to see what happened.

[01:19 PM] Agent: I can see that Broccoli (250g, ₹48) was removed during the packing stage because it was out of stock at the warehouse. A notification was supposed to be sent to you when the item was removed, but it looks like the notification failed to deliver. I can see the failed notification log on our end. I sincerely apologize for this.

[01:20 PM] Customer: That's really bad. I was making a specific recipe and broccoli was the main ingredient. If I'd known it was removed, I could have at least gone to the local store before starting to cook. Now my whole meal prep is messed up.

[01:22 PM] Agent: I completely understand, Lakshmi. Not being informed in time is worse than the item being unavailable. You should have had the chance to adjust your plans. I'm processing an immediate refund of ₹48 for the broccoli. I'm also adding ₹40 credit to your account for the inconvenience. And I've reported the notification failure to our tech team — this needs to be reliable.

[01:23 PM] Customer: Thanks. The refund is fine but I hope you fix the notification system. It's useless to remove items silently.

[01:24 PM] Agent: You're absolutely right. Timely notifications for item removals are critical and we're treating this as a high-priority bug. The ₹48 refund and ₹40 credit are now on your account. I'm sorry again, Lakshmi. Is there anything else I can help with?

[01:25 PM] Customer: No, that's it. Thanks Nisha.
