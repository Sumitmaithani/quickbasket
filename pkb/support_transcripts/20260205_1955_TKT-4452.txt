[07:55 PM] Customer: Your delivery person has been circling my apartment complex for 10 minutes. He called me twice but I can't explain the entrance over phone — it's confusing. The map pin is also wrong. Can someone help him?

[07:57 PM] Agent: Hi Aditi! I'm sorry about the difficulty. Let me contact the delivery partner right away and help guide him.

[07:59 PM] Agent: I've spoken with your delivery partner Manoj. The issue is that the GPS pin for your address is pointing to the back gate of Prestige Lakeside Habitat, which is closed after 7 PM. I've redirected him to the main gate on 6th Cross Road. He should be there in about 3 minutes.

[08:00 PM] Customer: Yes! The back gate is always wrong on maps. I've added delivery instructions in my address saying "Use main gate on 6th Cross" but the delivery person said he couldn't see any notes.

[08:02 PM] Agent: Let me check that. I can see you do have delivery instructions saved in your address, but there's a known issue where these notes don't always appear on the delivery partner's app when they're in navigation mode. I'm reporting this bug. In the meantime, I've manually sent your instructions to Manoj.

[08:04 PM] Customer: He just arrived! Finally. Thank you for the help, Rohan. Please fix that delivery notes thing — I shouldn't have to guide every delivery person manually.

[08:05 PM] Agent: Absolutely, Aditi. I've also corrected the GPS pin for your address in our system to point to the main gate entrance. Future deliveries should route correctly. And I've flagged the delivery notes visibility bug. Sorry for the hassle tonight!
