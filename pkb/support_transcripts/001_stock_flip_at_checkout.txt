[10:14 AM] Customer: Hi, I just placed an order and noticed that mushrooms were removed from my bag at the last second. They were showing in stock when I added them!

[10:16 AM] Agent: Hello Priya! I'm sorry about that. Let me pull up your order ORD-881204 and check what happened with the mushrooms.

[10:17 AM] Agent: I can see that 200g Button Mushrooms (₹45) were in your cart but got flagged as out-of-stock during the packing stage. Our warehouse team couldn't fulfill that item. Unfortunately, this sometimes happens when the last unit gets allocated to another order being packed simultaneously.

[10:18 AM] Customer: That's really frustrating. I was planning dinner around those mushrooms. Why does the app show "in stock" if it's not actually available?

[10:20 AM] Agent: I completely understand your frustration, Priya. Our inventory syncs every few minutes, but during high-demand periods there can be a small lag. We're actively working on real-time stock locks at the cart stage to prevent this. As a gesture of goodwill, I've added ₹50 QuickBasket credit to your account, which is more than the mushroom cost.

[10:21 AM] Customer: Okay, I appreciate the credit. But please fix this — it's happened to me twice now. It throws off my whole meal plan.

[10:22 AM] Agent: Absolutely noted, Priya. I've flagged this as a repeat issue on your account, and I'm escalating the feedback to our product team. You'll see the ₹50 credit reflected within the next few minutes. Is there anything else I can help with?

[10:23 AM] Customer: No, that's all. Thanks for the quick response.

[10:23 AM] Agent: You're welcome! Happy cooking, Priya. Have a great day!
