[11:00 AM] Customer: I chose eco-friendly packaging for my order, expecting minimal waste. But my 4-item order came wrapped in so much brown paper and cardboard that it was actually MORE packaging than a regular plastic bag would have been. This defeats the whole purpose.

[11:02 AM] Agent: Hi Nikhil! Thank you for choosing eco packaging, and I appreciate you pointing this out. That's an ironic outcome — let me look into what happened with order ORD-892781.

[11:04 AM] Agent: I checked with the warehouse and here's what likely happened: each item was individually wrapped in kraft paper for protection — eggs in a paper tray with paper padding, the glass sauce jar in corrugated cardboard, and even the chips packet got a paper sleeve. The intent is to protect items without plastic, but for a small order like yours, the paper usage can feel excessive compared to one plastic bag holding everything.

[11:05 AM] Customer: Exactly. I appreciate the intent, but wrapping a chips packet in paper is overkill. Chips already have their own packaging. Using more resources to be "eco-friendly" isn't actually eco-friendly.

[11:07 AM] Agent: That's a really thoughtful critique, Nikhil. You're right — true sustainability means using less material overall, not just swapping plastic for paper. I'm passing this to our sustainability team. The packaging guidelines for eco orders should be smarter about which items actually need protection and which ones (like sealed chip packets) can go without any additional wrapping.

[11:08 AM] Customer: Yeah, simple guidelines like "only wrap fragile items" would make a huge difference. I love that you offer the eco option — I just want it to be genuinely better, not just performatively green.

[11:09 AM] Agent: "Performatively green" — I'm quoting you on that in my feedback report because it captures the concern perfectly. Thank you for the constructive input, Nikhil. We'll work on making the eco packaging truly minimal and smart. Is there anything else?

[11:10 AM] Customer: No, that's all. Thanks Priyanka.

Internal Notes: Eco packaging excessive for small orders — 4 items individually wrapped in kraft paper including items that don't need protection (chips, sealed packets). Customer feedback: wrap only fragile items, reduce overall material use. Sustainability team feedback filed — recommend tiered eco packing guidelines: (1) fragile items get paper protection, (2) sealed/sturdy items skip extra wrapping, (3) small orders use single paper bag instead of individual wrapping. Current eco SOP is one-size-fits-all and leads to over-packaging.
