[06:42 PM] Customer: My order was supposed to arrive by 7 PM. Now the app says 7:45 PM. I specifically ordered early because I have guests coming at 7:30. What happened?

[06:44 PM] Agent: Hi Arvind! I'm really sorry about the delay. Let me check the status of your order ORD-882371 right away.

[06:46 PM] Agent: I can see that your order was packed and dispatched on time at 6:20 PM. However, there's heavy traffic reported on the Outer Ring Road stretch near Marathahalli, and our delivery partner Suresh is currently stuck in that congestion. The ETA was automatically updated based on live traffic data.

[06:47 PM] Customer: I understand traffic happens, but the app showed 25-min delivery when I ordered. That's what I planned around. You shouldn't promise times you can't keep.

[06:49 PM] Agent: You're absolutely right, Arvind. The original ETA is our commitment and we should be transparent when conditions change. I'll share your feedback with our logistics team about providing earlier notifications when ETAs shift significantly. I can see Suresh is now past the congestion zone and your updated ETA is closer to 7:30 PM now.

[06:50 PM] Customer: 7:30 is still cutting it close but at least that's better. Can you ask him to call me when he's at the gate? My apartment is a bit tricky to find.

[06:51 PM] Agent: Done! I've added a note for Suresh to call you upon arrival. I've also pinned your gate entry instructions from your saved address. I hope your dinner goes well, Arvind!

[06:52 PM] Customer: Thanks Sneha, appreciate the help.
