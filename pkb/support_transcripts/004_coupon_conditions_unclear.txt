[03:15 PM] Customer: I keep hearing about this ECO10 coupon that auto-applies when you choose eco-friendly packaging. I selected the paper bag option but I don't see any discount anywhere. Where does it show up?

[03:17 PM] Agent: Hi Deepak! Thanks for reaching out. Let me explain how ECO10 works — it's a bit different from regular coupons.

[03:19 PM] Agent: ECO10 is an automatic 10% discount (up to ₹40) that applies when two conditions are met: (1) you select eco-friendly packaging, and (2) your cart has at least 5 items. It shows up on the checkout summary page as a line item called "Eco Reward Discount." Could you check if you had 5 or more items in your cart?

[03:20 PM] Customer: I had 3 items. But the app tooltip just says "choose eco packing and save 10%!" — it doesn't say anything about needing 5 items. This is misleading.

[03:22 PM] Agent: I see how that's confusing, Deepak. The tooltip text was simplified for space, but you're right — it should mention the 5-item minimum upfront. I'm noting this as feedback for the team. The full conditions are listed on the Coupons page under ECO10, but I agree most users won't go looking there.

[03:23 PM] Customer: Yeah, I definitely didn't check the coupons page. I just saw the tooltip and assumed it was straightforward. Can you just apply it manually to my next order?

[03:25 PM] Agent: I can't manually override coupon conditions, but here's what I can do — next time you have 5+ items and choose eco packing, it will auto-apply. And I've shared your feedback about the tooltip wording with our product team. It's a very valid point and several customers have mentioned it.

[03:26 PM] Customer: Alright, fair enough. At least I know the rules now. Thanks Kavitha.

[03:26 PM] Agent: Happy to help, Deepak! And thank you for choosing eco-friendly packaging — every bit helps. Have a great evening!

Internal Notes: ECO10 auto-apply conditions not met (3 items, minimum is 5). Customer confusion stems from oversimplified tooltip text "choose eco packing and save 10%!" — does not mention 5-item minimum. Feedback logged for product/UX team. 4th similar complaint this month about ECO10 tooltip.
