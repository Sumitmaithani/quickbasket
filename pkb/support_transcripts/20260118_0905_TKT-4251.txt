[09:05 AM] Customer: I just paid ₹876 via UPI for my grocery order. The money was deducted from my bank account (I can see the SMS), but the app is showing "Order Failed - Please try again." What's going on? I don't want to be charged twice.

[09:07 AM] Agent: Hi Rajesh! I'm sorry about this — I understand how worrying this must be. Please don't try placing the order again just yet. Let me investigate the payment status immediately.

[09:10 AM] Agent: I've checked with our payment gateway. The UPI transaction (ref: UPI-9934782110) was received successfully on our end, but there was a timeout error when creating the order in our system. This is a known intermittent issue we're working to fix. The good news is your money is safe.

[09:11 AM] Customer: Okay but when do I get it back? And I still need my groceries.

[09:13 AM] Agent: I've initiated an immediate refund of ₹876 to your UPI-linked account. It should reflect within 2-4 hours, but definitely within 24 hours depending on your bank. You're free to place a new order right away — the original payment won't cause a duplicate charge since the order was never created.

[09:14 AM] Customer: Are you sure? Because last time this happened with another app, I got charged twice and spent two weeks getting my money back.

[09:16 AM] Agent: I completely understand your concern, Rajesh. I've personally verified that no order was created against this transaction, so there's zero chance of a duplicate charge. I'm also sending you an email confirmation of the refund with the reference number. If the refund doesn't show up within 24 hours, you can reply to that email or reach out here and we'll escalate it with the bank directly.

[09:17 AM] Customer: Okay, thanks Nisha. I'll place the order again now. Please fix this issue though — it's stressful.

[09:17 AM] Agent: Absolutely, Rajesh. I'm sorry again for the trouble. Our engineering team is actively working on this. Happy shopping!
