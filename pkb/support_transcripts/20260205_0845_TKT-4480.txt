[08:45 AM] Customer: The Harvest Gold whole wheat bread I received has an expiry date of February 6th — that's tomorrow! The bread already feels stale and hard. I paid ₹50 for fresh bread, not day-old bread.

[08:47 AM] Agent: Good morning Geeta! I'm sorry about that. You're absolutely right to expect fresh bread. Let me look at your order ORD-891578.

[08:49 AM] Agent: I can confirm the Harvest Gold Whole Wheat Bread (₹50) in your order. Our policy requires a minimum of 3 days before expiry for bakery items at the time of delivery. If the expiry is tomorrow (Feb 6), this bread should never have been dispatched. This is a clear quality check failure at the warehouse.

[08:50 AM] Customer: Exactly. I make my kids' school sandwiches with this bread every morning. I can't use bread that expires tomorrow and is already going stale. This is the first time this has happened, but it's disappointing.

[08:52 AM] Agent: I completely understand, Geeta. Nobody wants to serve near-expiry bread to their kids. I'm processing a full ₹50 refund right now. I'm also reporting this to our quality team — the warehouse should be checking expiry dates during packing for all bakery and dairy items.

[08:53 AM] Customer: Can I get a replacement instead? I still need bread for tomorrow's lunch boxes.

[08:54 AM] Agent: Of course! I've created a replacement order for the bread, and it will be delivered today in the 11 AM - 1 PM slot. I've added a note requesting freshest available stock (minimum 5-day expiry). The refund for the original bread will also go through. No need to return the stale bread — you can discard it.

[08:55 AM] Customer: Perfect, thank you Kavitha. Much appreciated.
