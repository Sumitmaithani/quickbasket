[09:18 AM] Customer: Hi, I placed my weekly grocery order this morning and just got a notification saying "Baby Spinach 100g has been removed from your order." It was in stock 20 minutes ago when I placed the order. This is confusing.

[09:20 AM] Agent: Good morning Fatima! I'm sorry about the baby spinach. Let me look into order ORD-885320.

[09:22 AM] Agent: I can see what happened — Baby Spinach 100g (₹40) went out of stock between when you placed the order (8:52 AM) and when the warehouse started packing (9:10 AM). During that window another order claimed the last available units.

[09:23 AM] Customer: I see. So basically there's no reservation when I checkout? The stock isn't held for my order?

[09:24 AM] Agent: That's correct, unfortunately. Right now, stock is checked at two points — when you add to cart and when the warehouse starts packing. But there's no hold or reservation in between. So if demand is high, the last units can get allocated to whichever order reaches packing first.

[09:25 AM] Customer: That seems like a pretty fundamental gap. Even movie ticket apps hold your seat for 10 minutes while you pay. You'd think a grocery app would do the same for perishable items.

[09:27 AM] Agent: That's actually a perfect analogy, and it's exactly the kind of "soft lock" system our product team is working on. The idea is to temporarily reserve inventory at checkout for a short window. It's in development but I don't have a timeline I can share yet.

[09:28 AM] Customer: I hope it comes soon. I'm not angry about the spinach — it's ₹40 — but I meal prep on Saturday mornings and if something drops out after I've already planned my meals, it's disruptive. I'd rather the app told me "low stock, might not be available" at checkout than just silently remove it later.

[09:30 AM] Agent: That's really valuable feedback, Fatima — the idea of a "low stock" warning at checkout is something I'm going to include in the escalation note. I've added ₹50 credit to your account for the inconvenience. And I'll make sure your specific suggestion gets to the product team.

[09:31 AM] Customer: Thanks Nisha, appreciate you actually listening. Have a good day.

[09:31 AM] Agent: You too, Fatima! Happy meal prepping. We'll do better on this.

Internal Notes: Baby Spinach 100g (₹40) went OOS between order placement (8:52 AM) and packing start (9:10 AM). 18-minute gap with no inventory reservation. ₹50 credit applied. Customer provided excellent product feedback: (1) implement soft-lock/reservation at checkout, (2) show "low stock" warning at checkout for items with <5 units. Both suggestions forwarded to product team alongside existing JIRA ENG-2750 (inventory lock feature). Customer tone: constructive, not angry. Retention risk: low, but issue frequency is increasing overall.
