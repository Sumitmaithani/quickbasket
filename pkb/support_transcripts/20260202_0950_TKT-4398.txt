[09:50 AM] Customer: The app completely froze when I tapped "Place Order" on the checkout screen. The screen went white for about 10 seconds and I couldn't do anything. Then it came back but I'm not sure if my order went through or not. I'm scared to tap again in case I get double charged.

[09:52 AM] Agent: Hi Siddharth! That sounds like a frustrating experience. Let me check if an order was created from your account.

[09:54 AM] Agent: Good news — no order was placed and no payment was charged. The freeze happened before the payment step was triggered. Your cart is still intact with all items. You're safe to try placing the order again.

[09:55 AM] Customer: Okay, that's a relief. But why did it freeze? I'm on a Pixel 7a with the latest app version. My internet is fine.

[09:57 AM] Agent: Thanks for those details. We've been seeing some checkout screen freezes on Android devices running our latest app version (v4.2.1). Our engineering team identified it as a memory issue that occurs when the checkout page tries to load multiple payment options and coupons simultaneously. A fix is going out in v4.2.2, which should be available on the Play Store within the next 2-3 days.

[09:58 AM] Customer: Alright. Any workaround for now?

[09:59 AM] Agent: Yes — try closing any background apps before checking out, and if the freeze happens again, just wait about 10-15 seconds and it should recover. Also, if you have a specific payment method you usually use, you can set it as default in Settings > Payment — this reduces what the checkout page needs to load. Sorry for the trouble, Siddharth!

[10:00 AM] Customer: Got it. Just placed the order and it went through fine this time. Thanks!

Internal Notes: Checkout screen freeze — known issue in v4.2.1 on Android. Memory spike when loading payment options + coupon eligibility simultaneously. No order or payment was created during the freeze. Customer placed order successfully on retry. Fix scheduled in v4.2.2 (ETA: Feb 4-5). JIRA ENG-2908. Recommend adding a loading state instead of white screen for graceful degradation.
