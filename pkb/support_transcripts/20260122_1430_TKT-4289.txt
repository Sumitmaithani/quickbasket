[02:30 PM] Customer: I was told I'd receive a refund of ₹324 within 5-7 business days for order ORD-879856. It's been 9 days and I still haven't received anything. This is unacceptable.

[02:32 PM] Agent: Hi Ananya! I sincerely apologize for the delay. Let me check the refund status for your order right away.

[02:35 PM] Agent: I've looked into this and I can see the refund was processed on our end on Jan 13th (refund ref: RFD-20260113-3987). However, it appears the transaction is stuck in a "pending" state with the payment gateway. This sometimes happens with certain bank processors. I'm escalating this with our finance team to push the refund through immediately.

[02:36 PM] Customer: This is the second time I've had to follow up on a refund. The first time you said 5-7 days, then I waited, and now I have to chase you for my own money. It's not a good experience.

[02:38 PM] Agent: You're absolutely right, Ananya, and I take full responsibility for this falling through the cracks. I've done two things: (1) escalated the stuck refund to our finance team with a priority flag — you should see the ₹324 back in your account within 24-48 hours, and (2) added ₹75 QuickBasket credit to your account as an apology for the delay and inconvenience.

[02:39 PM] Customer: I appreciate the credit but I just want my refund. Please make sure it actually comes through this time.

[02:40 PM] Agent: I will personally follow up on this tomorrow, Ananya. I'll send you an update via email by 12 PM tomorrow regardless of the status. You have my word.

[02:41 PM] Customer: Fine. Thanks Vikram.
