[08:20 AM] Customer: Just received my order and 4 out of 6 eggs are cracked. I've attached a photo. This is the second time this has happened with eggs from QuickBasket.

[08:22 AM] Agent: Good morning Farhan! I'm so sorry to see that. Let me pull up your order ORD-885673 and review the photo you've shared.

[08:24 AM] Agent: I can clearly see the damage in your photo — 4 cracked eggs out of the 6-pack (₹42). This is unacceptable and I sincerely apologize. I can see from your history that you had a similar issue on Jan 5th as well. We clearly need to do better with egg packaging.

[08:25 AM] Customer: Yeah, that's exactly my point. Twice in one month. The eggs aren't packed properly — they just put them in the bag with other heavy items.

[08:27 AM] Agent: You're absolutely right, and this has been escalated to our packaging team. For your current order, I'm processing an immediate refund of ₹42 for the eggs — it'll be credited to your original payment method within 24 hours. I'm also adding ₹30 credit to your account for the repeated inconvenience.

[08:28 PM] Customer: Can you also flag that eggs should be packed on top or in a separate section? I've seen other delivery apps do that with a small egg tray.

[08:30 AM] Agent: That's excellent feedback, Farhan. I've noted it in our packaging improvement tracker. We're actually piloting protective egg trays in some zones — I'll check if your area (Koramangala) is part of that rollout. In the meantime, your ₹42 refund and ₹30 credit have been applied. Is there anything else?

[08:31 AM] Customer: No, that's good. Thanks Priyanka. Hope the egg tray thing happens soon!

Internal Notes: Repeat damaged eggs issue — 2nd occurrence in 30 days for this customer. Photo confirmed 4/6 eggs cracked. ₹42 refund processed (RFD-20260126-4318) + ₹30 credit. Packaging feedback escalated — eggs packed alongside heavy items (2L milk, atta bag). Koramangala zone not yet in egg tray pilot. Recommend prioritizing this zone for pilot expansion.
