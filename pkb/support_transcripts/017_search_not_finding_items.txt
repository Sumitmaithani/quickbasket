[10:40 AM] Customer: I tried searching for "dahi" in the app but got zero results. I had to search for "curd" to find it. Same thing with "atta" — I had to type "wheat flour" to get results. Why doesn't the search understand basic Hindi words?

[10:42 AM] Agent: Hi Ramesh! Thanks for bringing this up. You're right — these are very commonly used terms and our search should absolutely recognize them. Let me note down the specific terms you tried.

[10:43 AM] Customer: "Dahi" gave no results. "Atta" gave no results. I also tried "besan" and got nothing — had to search "gram flour." My mother-in-law uses the app too and she only knows the Hindi names. She thinks we don't sell these items.

[10:45 AM] Agent: That's a great point and I can see how this would be especially difficult for users who primarily think in Hindi terms. Currently our search is primarily indexed on English product names, which is a significant gap. I'm escalating this to our product and search teams as a high-priority improvement.

[10:46 AM] Customer: This should have been there from day one. You're an Indian app selling to Indian customers. Not everyone uses English names for groceries.

[10:48 AM] Agent: You're absolutely right, Ramesh. There's no excuse for this gap. I've filed this as a priority feature request and included your specific examples (dahi, atta, besan) along with the point about accessibility for users who prefer Hindi terms. While I can't give an exact timeline, I want you to know this feedback is being taken seriously.

[10:49 AM] Customer: Okay. I hope it gets fixed soon. Thanks.

[10:49 AM] Agent: Thank you for the valuable feedback, Ramesh. I'll follow up with the product team and if there's an update, we'll announce it. Have a good day!

Internal Notes: Search doesn't support Hindi/vernacular terms — "dahi" (curd), "atta" (wheat flour), "besan" (gram flour) return zero results. Major gap for Hindi-speaking users. Priority feature request filed — JIRA PROD-1847. Customer mentioned mother-in-law abandons searches thinking items aren't available. Impacts discoverability and potential revenue. Search team to explore Hindi synonym mapping + transliteration support.
