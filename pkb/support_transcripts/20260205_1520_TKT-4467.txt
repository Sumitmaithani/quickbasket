[03:20 PM] Customer: I tried paying ₹1,430 via UPI (Google Pay) for my order. The app showed "Payment Failed" and told me to retry. But my bank already deducted the money — I have the SMS confirmation. Transaction ref: GPAY20260205143012. I'm not retrying until I know what happened to my money.

[03:22 PM] Agent: Hi Manish! You're right to not retry. Let me investigate this immediately with our payment team. Please give me 2-3 minutes.

[03:26 PM] Agent: I've checked with our payment gateway. The transaction GPAY20260205143012 shows as "initiated" on our end but never received a "success" confirmation from Google Pay's servers. This means the payment is in a limbo state — your bank deducted it, but the confirmation didn't reach us. This typically auto-reverses within 24-48 hours.

[03:27 PM] Customer: 24-48 hours? That's ₹1,430 stuck for two days! I need those groceries today. What am I supposed to do?

[03:29 PM] Agent: I understand this is very inconvenient, Manish. Here's what I'm doing: (1) I've raised a payment dispute with Google Pay through our backend — this sometimes speeds up the reversal to within a few hours, (2) I've added ₹1,430 as temporary QuickBasket wallet credit to your account so you can place your order right now without waiting. Once the UPI reversal comes through to your bank, we'll adjust the wallet credit.

[03:30 PM] Customer: Okay that's helpful. But what if the reversal doesn't happen in 48 hours?

[03:31 PM] Agent: If it doesn't auto-reverse within 48 hours, contact us again and we'll escalate directly with your bank and Google Pay with all the transaction details. I'm also sending you an email with the dispute reference number for your records. You won't lose this money, Manish — I assure you.

[03:32 PM] Customer: Alright, I'll place the order with the wallet credit. Thanks Vikram. Hoping this gets resolved quickly.
