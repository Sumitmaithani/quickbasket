[01:58 PM] Agent: Confirmed — Tomatoes 500g (₹24) were removed during packing due to stock-out. I can process a refund or add QuickBasket credit. Which would you prefer?

[01:59 PM] Customer: Refund to original payment method please

[02:00 PM] Agent: Done! ₹24 refund initiated to your UPI account. Should reflect within 24 hours. Is there anything else I can help with?

Internal Notes: Tomatoes 500g (₹24) OOS during packing. Straightforward refund — customer didn't want credit or explanation. Refund processed (RFD-20260119-4260). Another stock-flip instance. No escalation needed — customer seemed more indifferent than upset. Quick resolution.
