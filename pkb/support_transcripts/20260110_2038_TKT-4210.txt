[08:38 PM] Customer: hey, just got my delivery and the coriander bunch is missing? it was in my cart when i checked out for sure

[08:40 PM] Agent: Hi Vikram! Sorry about the missing coriander. Let me check order ORD-881876.

[08:41 PM] Agent: Yes, I can see Fresh Coriander Bunch (₹15) was removed during packing because it went out of stock at the warehouse. You should have received a notification about this — did you get one?

[08:42 PM] Customer: nope nothing. i only found out when i opened the bag and it wasnt there. kinda annoying since i needed it for tonight's dal

[08:43 PM] Agent: That's not great — the notification should have gone out when the item was removed. I apologize for that. I'm adding ₹20 credit to your account for the trouble. It's a small amount but covers more than the coriander cost.

[08:44 PM] Customer: ya its not about the money really, its just annoying when you plan a meal and then stuff is randomly missing. happens on other apps too but still

[08:45 PM] Agent: Totally understand. We're working on locking inventory when items are added to cart so this doesn't happen. Sorry again Vikram — the ₹20 credit is already on your account.

[08:45 PM] Customer: cool thanks

Internal Notes: Coriander bunch (₹15) OOS during packing. Item removal notification did not reach customer (delivery confirmed but push notification status unclear — possible silent failure). ₹20 credit applied. Customer was not upset but noted the inconvenience. Stock-flip issue continuing — 4th report this week.
