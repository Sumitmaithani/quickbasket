Category: Delivery - Tracking Issue
Order ID: ORD-886220
Status: resolved
Resolution: explanation

[12:45 PM] Customer: My order tracking has been stuck on "Out for Delivery" for the last 30 minutes. The delivery person's location dot hasn't moved at all on the map. Is something wrong?

[12:47 PM] Agent: Hi Kavita! Let me check on your order ORD-886220 right away.

[12:49 PM] Agent: I've contacted the delivery partner, Raju, and he's confirmed he's on the way. The tracking dot appears stuck because he's in an area with poor GPS signal (the Indiranagar underpass stretch). The live location requires a strong GPS connection to update. He estimates reaching you in about 10-12 minutes.

[12:50 PM] Customer: Oh okay. I was worried the order was lost or something. The app should at least show a message like "GPS signal weak" instead of just freezing.

[12:52 PM] Agent: That's a really smart suggestion, Kavita. Right now the map just stops updating silently, which I agree is anxiety-inducing. I've passed along your idea about showing a "weak signal" indicator to our product team. In the meantime, I'll keep an eye on your delivery and make sure Raju reaches you soon.

[12:53 PM] Customer: Thanks Amit. I'll wait.

[01:04 PM] Customer: Got it! He just delivered. Thanks for checking.

[01:05 PM] Agent: Wonderful! Glad it arrived safely. Sorry about the tracking scare. Have a great afternoon, Kavita!
